The application offers the possibility for students and parents to always keep track of their progress.

The progress is stored based on the marks which are gradually added in the database by the teachers.

Teachers organise their students in groups by adding them in particular to each class group. In order to do that, they user each student's private random code which identifies the student so that marks and partnerships remain private.
